# Sorting-and-searching-algorithms

## Description
The "Card Sorting Algorithm" is a simple program that allows you to sort a collection of cards represented as an array of integers using the insertion sort algorithm. The program includes a `sort` procedure for sorting the cards and an `insertion_sort` algorithm that interacts with the user to input and display the sorted cards.

## Usage
You can use the "Card Sorting Algorithm" program to sort a set of cards by following these steps:

1. Enter the number of cards you want to sort.
2. Input the values of the cards one by one.
3. The program will then sort the cards using the insertion sort algorithm.
4. It will display the sorted cards.

### Example
Suppose you want to sort a set of cards with the values `[5, 2, 9, 1, 4]`. After entering the values and running the program, it will display the following output:

Enter how many cards you have: 5

Card [1] = 5

Card [2] = 2

Card [3] = 9

Card [4] = 1

Card [5] = 4

The sorted cards:
1
2
4
5
9
